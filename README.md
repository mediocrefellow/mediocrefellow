- 👋 Hi, I’m @mediocrefellow I'm a former game coder/web designer and dev. I no longer code but I still do design work and sound engineering.
I also have a lot of ideas and have a great mind for high concept devopment. I'm very into crypto currency and NFTs at the moment. I was part of the
Fundfindr.com core team in 2008, which was among the first pioneers of social media crowd funding when web 2.0 was just beginning to gain traction (7 years before kickstarter).
I can contribute original soundtracks, voiceover, promotional materials, illustration, marketing images and copy etc. 
- 👀 I’m interested in Music, Art, GUI and UX, gaming, UI, Machine Learning cryptocurrency and blockchain based technology....
- 🌱 I’m currently learning every day...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects with social conscience....
